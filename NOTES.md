CURRENTLY:

BUGS:
    - brief flicker of non-faded scene at startup, just one frame but it's visible

TODO:
    - Postprocessing shader to make Gameboy looking graphics
        - We need a color attachment texture, see  encoder.begin_render_pass in GameState and GameUi, both take the frame color attachment. We can presumably make a texture view like we do for depth, and then make a later pass which does take the frame color attachment which runs a shader transform.
