CURRENTLY:
TODO:
    - Implement game UI
        - Numerics - There might be a hacky way with a bunch of separate SpawnPoints, but look into a data layer which can add some kind of metadata to a tile??? Will require some more parsing
    - Need "vials", "hearts" and any other power up gubbins
    - Postprocessing shader to make Gameboy looking graphics
        - We need a color attachment texture, see  encoder.begin_render_pass in GameState and GameUi, both take the frame color attachment. We can presumably make a texture view like we do for depth, and then make a later pass which does take the frame color attachment which runs a shader transform.

BUGS:
    - white single-pixel lines between sprites at some offsets, likely do to pixel snapping
        - could outset sprites a half pixel (what's apixel at different scales?)
        - could make each "layer" an indexed mesh
            - this will break texture mapping right?


LOW PRIORITY:
    - Refactor geom.rs, I don't like that module's existence.
    - Uniforms struct can be parameterized on the underlying data...but should it? Right now camera::Uniforms is essentially identical to sprite::Uniforms. Could make a Uniform<camera::UniformData> or something like that, will need trait constraints for btytemuck::Pod and Zeroable
