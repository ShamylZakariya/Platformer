CURRENTLY:
    Character Controller
        - needs ceiling collisions
        - needs ceiling ratchet collisions
            - the only tiles with ratchet collisions are half-height, with collider geometry being top-half.


BUGS:


TODO:
    - Uniforms struct can be parameterized on the underlying data...but should it? Right now camera::Uniforms is essentially identical to sprite::Uniforms.
